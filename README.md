You use one computer as the codemasters computer and another one as the game board everyone sees. The codemasters can mark the words as revelead by clicking on them. All communications happens over UDP boardcast so the two computers need to be on the same WiFi network using a slightly modified verision of hte [UDPComms](https://github.com/stanfordroboticsclub/UDPâ€¦) library.
